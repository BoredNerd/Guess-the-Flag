# Guess-the-Flag
A simple game made in Python ( PyQT5 & Qtdesigner) which the user has to guess the right flag of the country

requirement :
- it may not work for python 10, I used Python 9

NOTE :
before running the file runme.py , extract all the file of flagcode.rar and put them on a folder called "flagcode" (this must be in the same directory of runme.py)
